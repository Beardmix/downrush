README instructions for running the Deluge xmlView program locally on your
local computer without needing a FlashAir card.

INSTALLATION:

Uncompress the distribution ZIP file and copy the xmlView directory over onto your
Deluge SD card at the root level (next to SAMPLES, KITS, SYNTHS, and SONGS).

OPERATION:

With the Deluge SD card in your computer, open up the xmlView directory and
double click on 'viewXML.htm', which will start the program in your browser.
As an alternative, you can use your browser's File menu and select 'Open Fileâ€¦'
which will do the same thing.

You will now see a simple web page with a Choose File button in the upper left hand corner.
Press that and locate a SONG, SYNTH, or KIT XML file you want to examine.

The program will then load the XML file into the browser and generate a more
human-readable display of its contents. This display feature is still under development
and there are many details not yet shown. Several of the displays show a 'periodic table'
which display the values of the synthesizer parameters organized to match the shortcuts imprinted
on the Deluge control grid.

The black triangle wedges on the left-hand side of tracks and samples are used to open up
detail-views of 'periodic tables'.

While there are some buttons related to track copy/paste, you can't save stuff yet.

You can change the file under investigation by clicking on the Choose File button again.
I recommend book-marking the viewXML.htm page in your browser to make openning it easier.

NOTE: Users of the Downrush system with FlashAir cards don't need to install xmlView
separately. It is already present in the DR directory.
