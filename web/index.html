<h3>Downrush Direct File Editors</h3>

Downrush is a suite of programs for viewing and manipulating music files for the <a href='https://synthstrom.com/'>Synthstrom Deluge</a> and the <a href='https://www.akaipro.com/force-forcexus'>Akai Force.</a>
<p>
They all work by having you "upload" a file of interest for viewing, editing, or importing. Most programs let you modify your file or generate a new one. The result-file is downloaded back onto your computer into your Downloads directory. Since the files never actually leave your computer, these programs are fast and secure.
